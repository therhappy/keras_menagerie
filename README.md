# Keras Menagerie
A collection of custom objects to use with keras and tensorflow

# Credo
Research goes faster if implementation doesn't suck up weeks

# List of objects
## Models
### LossUpdaterModel
A Keras Model that collects updates from the loss it's compiled with and passe them to ops.
## Losses
### BEGANLoss
A Loss object based on BEGAN adaptative architecture by Berthelot et al [1].
Main point is having parameters that adapt to current performance. This is to be used with a discriminator autoencoder.
Current implementation assumes that, during the training, even-numbered rows are issued from actual training set while odd-numbered rows are generated by the adversarial model.
